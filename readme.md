# 2017 Ford GoBike Analysis
## by Jamie Farley


## Dataset

This dataset is a collection of data provided by the Ford GoBike system which is a public bicycle sharing system located in San Francisco, California. They launched in June of 2017 and they have over 2,600 bicycles and 262 stations across San Francisco. These bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to another station in the city. The bikes are available 24/7 all year long and riders can be subscribers or one-time customers. This data was collected from June 2017 to December of 2017 and it features user types, rider age, rider gender, and more.


## Summary of Findings

There was a lot of information gathered from this dataset. The main feature that I wanted to focus on was the difference between customers and subscribers when it came to age, ride duration, most popular days of the week, and most popular hours of the day. There are almost 400,000 subscribers compared to about 50,000 customers and more than 75% of them are male. I also found that subscriber's most frequent days of use are Monday through Friday and at 8:00am and 5:00pm. One could infer that this means subscribers are using the bikes to get to and from work since those time frames are when most people are traveling to and from work. In contrast, customers tend to use the bikes the most on the weekend and throughout the day time hours. Also, I found that customers had a longer duration of ride compared to subscribers overall. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

My key insights for my presentation are the weekly and hourly usage of the bike system by user type and age. I also want to show the trip duration as well. I had one change in design for my presentation and it was to use a cohesive color palette for all of my plots.
